# üçï Pizza Time - Java I/O Assignment

## Overview
Welcome to 1994! You're tasked with creating Winnipeg's first pizza delivery place with online ordering. This command-line application will handle address validation and delivery radius checking for pizza orders.

## Core Requirements (15 marks)
Create a Java application that:
1. Collects delivery information from users:
   - Street name
   - Street number
   - City
   - Postal code

2. Validates the delivery address against these criteria:
   - City must be "Winnipeg"
   - Street must be in the approved list: ["Burrows", "Main", "Henderson", "Magnus", "Mountain"]
   - Postal code must follow the format A1A 1A1 (letter-number-letter space number-letter-number)

3. Implements error handling:
   - Must handle incorrect data type inputs
   - Should re-prompt users when invalid data is entered
   - Must validate postal code format

4. Provides delivery status:
   - Clearly communicate whether the address is within the delivery radius

## Additional Features (Choose to earn full marks)

### Case-Insensitive Address Matching (1 mark)
- Implement case-insensitive comparison for street and city inputs
- Normalize input data before comparison

### Delivery Charge Calculation (2 marks)
- Calculate delivery fees based on street distance
- Implement a fixed fee structure per street

### Order Customization (2 marks)
- Add pizza size selection (Small, Medium, Large)
- Include topping selection options
- Display order summary with total cost

### Persistent Order History (3 marks)
- Save completed orders to a file
- Implement functionality to view order history
- Maintain persistent storage of order data

### Dynamic Delivery Area Expansion (2 marks)
- Allow addition of new streets to delivery area
- Maintain expanded delivery area during program execution

### Postal Code Area Validation (2 marks)
- Implement specific first-letter validation for postal codes
- Define acceptable postal code prefixes for delivery area

### Interactive Menu System (2 marks)
- Create navigable menu interface
- Implement back and forth navigation between options
- Include main menu, order customization, and order history views

## Helpful Code Snippets

### Character Operations
```java
// Get character at specific position
String text = "Hello";
char letter = text.charAt(2); // Gets 'l'

// Check if character is digit
char c = '5';
boolean isNumber = Character.isDigit(c); // Returns true

// Check if character is letter
char firstChar = text.charAt(0);
boolean isFirstCharLetter = Character.isLetter(firstChar); // Returns true
```

## Grading
- Base Implementation: 15 marks
- Additional Features: Up to 7 marks
- Total Possible: 20+ marks
